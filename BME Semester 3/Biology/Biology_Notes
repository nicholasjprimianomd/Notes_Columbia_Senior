I. Animal Digestion
Nutrients
    Trace Nutrients
        Vitamins
        Minerals (Zinc, Iron)
-Once food is acquired food is mechanically processed
-After mechanical processing food is chemically processed in enzymes and acids
so that it can be used for energy.
    -Extracelluar digestion: chemical processing that takes places in the body
    but outside cells
        -Takes places in a thin piece of tissues that covers a structure or
        lines a cavity (galnds digestive epithlia)
        -Digestive juices
        -All animals use this
    -Intracellular digestion: chunks of food are engulfed by cells through
    endocytosis and packaged in digestive vacuoles
      -Only simple animals use intracellular digestion
-AFterfood is process mechanically and chemically food is absorbed across
the digestive epithelia which typically has a greatly enlarged surface
(exchange surface).
-Exchange surfaces always have an interface with the circulatory system for
distribution.
-Finally undigested waste is eliminated.

II. Digestive Systems: Structural View
  A. Digestive  Cavity = gastrovascular civility
    1.Hydra
    2. Flatworm
      a.These animals are built like a sack with only a single opening
        i. Both food and waste traverse the same opening
        ii. Digestive skin that lines the  gastrovascular cavity is .....
        iii. Gland cells release enzymes to chemically process food
        (extracellular)
        iv. can not chew
        v. two types of cell in the gastrovascular: one for secretion of
        digestive juices and one for abortion

    B. Digestive Track = food moves in one direction
      1. Tube within a tube
      2. Food enters through the mouth, is deconstructed, and exits through the
      anus
        i. Mouth, esophagus, crop (storage so more food can be collected before
        it is processed), gizzard (muscualar organ that future mechanically
        processed food), stomach, intestine (furthuer processed and absorbed)
III. Herbivores: Animals that feed on mostly plants
  A. Problems using plants as food
    1. Plants have indigestible cell wall made of cellulose (no animals have
    enzymes to break down cellulose)
    2.Leaves and stems are less calorie dense and protein dense than animals
    3. Plants have defense (spices, aromatic, nutmeg), sutural defenses
    (spines, crystals)
  B. Chemical Processing
    1. Microorganisms in a cow digest sugar and breakdown fat to produces
    various absorbable products but also a lot of methane (greenhouse gas).
    2. Rabbits use cecotropes

I. Metabolism: Food + 0_2 -> Energy + Nutrients + wastes
  A. 10^4 years ago - reducing atmosphere (little 0_2)
    1. Photosynthesis (C0_2 + H_20 -> sugars + 0_2)
      i. Energy stored as ATP
  B. Metabolic Pathways (both used in humans)
      1. Anaerobic pathway (no 0_2) - glycolysis and fermentation
        i. 1 glucose / 2ATP
        ii. Used in humans as bust activity
      2. Aerobic Pathway (0_2) - Citric acid cycle and electron transport chain
        ii. 1 glucose / 34 ATP
  C. Structures
    1. Acquisition of 0-2
      A. Mechanism of 0_2 Acquisition
        1. Diffusion - movement of molecules from one place to another as a
        result of their internal heat energy
    2. Destitution of 0_2
    3. Utilization (cellular motabolism)
