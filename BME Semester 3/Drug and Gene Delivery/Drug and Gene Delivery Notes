Controlled Drug Release
-Goal is to delivery as much drug as possible to a particular site (without
systemic exposure)
-The brain is a good site for controlled drug delivery
-Bioavaility in the brain is poor
-Intestinal and eye treatment could also benefit from controlled drug delivery
  -The eye is an attractive tissue because the bioavailability is low
  (cornal layer and blinking)
  -Only 5% of drug from eye drops enters the eye
