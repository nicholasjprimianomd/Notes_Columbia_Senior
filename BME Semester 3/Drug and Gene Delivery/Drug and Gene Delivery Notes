Controlled Drug Release
-Goal is to delivery as much drug as possible to a particular site (without
systemic exposure)
-The brain is a good site for controlled drug delivery
-Bioavaility in the brain is poor
-Intestinal and eye treatment could also benefit from controlled drug delivery
  -The eye is an attractive tissue because the bioavailability is low
  (cornal layer and blinking)
  -Only 5% of drug from eye drops enters the eye
-Transdermal Delivery Device
  -Attractive for hormonal delivery
  -Consists of a backing film, drug reservoir, microporous membrane,
  release disk, adhesive, and release layer
  -Patch may last up to one week
  -Only a small class of compounds can get through the dermal layer
    -Durg must have a low molecular weight and be lipophilic
    -Protiens can not get through the dermal layer
    -Microneedles are a potential solution (in development)
      -Miconeedles are very small and solid or dissolvable
      -Dissolvable might be made of PLA, PGA, or PLGA (bulk degrading)
        -Degrade in lactic acid and glycolic acid
        -These are products of the Krebs cycle and glycolysis (biocompatible) but
        causes high local acidity (must be quickly cleared by the body)
      -Therapeutic index of a drug is ratio of the toxic concentration to the
      effective concentration
-Cell membrane is negatively charged so only positively charged molecules will
enter the cell
  -The cell membrane is made of a phospholipid bilayer so polar compounds
  cannot enter
  Gene Delivery Systems:
    -One solution is chemical modification or conjunction
    -Viral vectors (there is a gene therapy viral product on the market)
    -Non-viral vectors (polyplex, lioplex, liopsome, micelles)
Pros and Cons of Drug vs. Gene Delivery
-Drugs
  -No type of compound limitation
  -More predictable temporal and spatial profile
  -Some damage of bioactivity
  -Formulation required
-Gene
  -Limited to proteins (control at the molecular level and applicable to
  non-soluble factors)
  -More difficult to control rate, level, and duration
  -Bioactive; may act in paracrine (local region) manner
  -Simple; convenient in evaluating new factors but hard to develop into a
  product because of the possibility of making other unwanted changes to the
  genome
-FDA approval is difficult to obtain for gene delivery
-Risk/benefit ratio*
  -For diabetes this ratio is not favorable because people can live almost
  normal lives without gene therapy
-Viral delivery is more efficient because they have mechanisms to get into cells
-Both viral and non-viral vectors have poor targeting efficiently
-Viral vectors have limited packing size
-Toxicity/Immunogenicity are concerns with viral vectors

-DNA Vaccination
  -Introduce only the antigen protein without the unwanted side effects
  associated with bacterial and viral vaccines
  -Express the antigen in its native form for optimal processing and presentation
  -DNA Vaccines are not immunogenic
-Toxicity and therapeutics are often two sides on the same coin
  -Dosage is very important
  -(Don't drink 10L of water quickly, you will die...wtf?)
-Combination therapy targets multiple pathways to inhibit growth of tumor
cells
  -Kill tumor vasculature to trap drug in the tumor
  -Combination therapy presents a challenge to drug delivery because each drug
  will have different properties (how do you maintain the correct ratio and
  release rate of each drug?)
-Drug Delivery Device: Implantable Osmotic Pump (very successful)
  -dM/dt = A/L lambda*(sigma*delta PI)*C
-Implantable Insulin Pump
  -Attractive because it remove the need for painful daily injections
  -Challenging because tissue grows and blocks the catheter
  -Hard to pack a large dose an insulin in the pump
  -Must be refillable pump and rechargeable battery
  -Currently in development
-Compartmental Models of Pharmacokinetics
  - -kM = dm/dt
  - M = mass in the compartment
  - k = first-order elimination constant
  - M = M0*e^(-kt)
  - c = (M0/Vd)*e^(-kt)
  - c = concentration in the compartment
  - Vd = volume of distribution
  -IN pharmacology, the volume of distribution is the theoretical volume that
  would be necessary to contain the total amount of an administer drug at the
  same concentration that it is observed in the blood plasma
-Absorption throughout the GI tract or leakage into circulation after
subcutaneous injection
  - dM/dt = kaD - kM
 - D = dose in abbsorbtion compartment
 - ka = first-order rate constant
 - dD/dt = -kaD
