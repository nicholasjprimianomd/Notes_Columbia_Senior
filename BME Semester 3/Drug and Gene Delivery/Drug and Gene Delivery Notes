Controlled Drug Release
-Goal is to delivery as much drug as possible to a particular site (without
systemic exposure)
-The brain is a good site for controlled drug delivery
-Bioavaility in the brain is poor
-Intestinal and eye treatment could also benefit from controlled drug delivery
  -The eye is an attractive tissue because the bioavailability is low
  (cornal layer and blinking)
  -Only 5% of drug from eye drops enters the eye
-Transdermal Delivery Device
  -Attractive for hormonal delivery
  -Consists of a backing film, drug reservoir, microporous membrane,
  release disk, adhesive, and release layer
  -Patch may last up to one week
  -Only a small class of compounds can get through the dermal layer
    -Durg must have a low molecular weight and be lipophilic
    -Protiens can not get through the dermal layer
    -Microneedles are a potential solution (in development)
      -Miconeedles are very small and solid or dissolvable
      -Dissolvable might be made of PLA, PGA, or PLGA (bulk degrading)
        -Degrade in lactic acid and glycolic acid
        -These are products of the Krebs cycle and glycolysis (biocompatibe) but
        causes high local acidity (must be quickly cleared by the body)
      -Therapudic index of a drug is ratio of the toxic concentration to the
      effective concentration
-Cell membrane is negatively charged so only positively charged molecules will
enter the cell
  -The cell membrane is made of a phospholipid bilayer so polar compounds
  cannot enter
  Gene Delivery Systems:
    -One solution is chemical modification or conjunction
    -Viral vectors (there is a gene therapy viral product on the market)
    -Nonviral vectors (polyplex, lioplex, liopsome, micelles)
Pros and Cons of Drug vs. Gene Delivery
-Durgs
  -No type of compound limitation
  -More predictable temporal and spatial profile
  -Some damage of bioactivity
  -Formulation required
-Gene
  -Limited to proteins (control at the molecular level and applicable to
  non-soluble factors)
  -More difficult to control rate, level, and duration
  -Bioactive; may act in paracrine (local region) manner
  -Simple; convenient in evaluating new factors but hard to develop into a
  product because of the possibility of making other unwanted changes to the
  genome
-FDA approval is difficult to obtain for gene delivery
-Risk/benefit ratio*
  -For diabetes this ratio is not favorable because people can live almost
  normal lives without gene therapy
-Viral delivery is more efficient because they have mechanisms to get into cells
-Both viral and non-virval vectors have poor targeting efficiently
-Virval vectors have limited packing size
-Toxcitiy/Immunigenicity are concerns with viral vectors
