Controlled Drug Release
-Goal is to delivery as much drug as possible to a particular site (without
systemic exposure)
-The brain is a good site for controlled drug delivery
-Bioavaility in the brain is poor
-Intestinal and eye treatment could also benefit from controlled drug delivery
  -The eye is an attractive tissue because the bioavailability is low
  (cornal layer and blinking)
  -Only 5% of drug from eye drops enters the eye
-Transdermal Delivery Device
  -Attractive for hormonal delivery
  -Consists of a backing film, drug reservoir, microporous membrane, release disk,
  adhesive, and release layer
  -Patch may last up to one week
  -Only a small class of compounds can get through the dermal layer
    -Durg must have a low molecular weight and be lipophilic
    -Protiens can not get through the dermal layer
    -Microneedles are a potential solution (in development)
